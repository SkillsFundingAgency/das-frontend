                            Setting off on a career path can be overwhelming for young people. As their parent, guardian
                            or
                            carer, you’ll play a key role in guiding them as they take their next step. Whether they get
                            top
                            grades or don’t thrive in academic environments, apprenticeships shouldn’t be overlooked.
                            With
                            new higher and degree apprenticeships popping up each year, they could get the best of both
                            worlds – learning and earning at the same time.

                        <p>
                            Perceptions of apprenticeships as entry-level, trade-based, low-quality courses persist –
                            yet
                            this couldn’t be further from today’s reality. Changes to funding, minimum requirements and
                            the
                            development of occupation-focused standards have driven up the quality of apprenticeships,
                            and
                            employers are taking notice. While earning a wage, apprentices gain highly transferable
                            skills
                            and qualifications (which could include a degree) to set them up for a wide range of career
                            paths.
                            Alongside this, they’ll gain hands-on experience in a real-world setting – an invaluable
                            asset when
                            it comes to future employment.

                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            An apprenticeship can boost a young person’s career, while offering great financial
                            benefits.
                            They’ll be paid (at least the national minimum wage, but often a more competitive salary),
                            and
                            they’ll spend at least 20% of their time completing off-the-job training – at no cost to
                            them.
                            This could include working towards a degree or other qualifications. At the same time,
                            they’ll
                            gain experience in a real workplace, and develop important soft skills as they transition
                            into
                            the world of work.

                            From digital marketing and teaching to dental healthcare and textile manufacturing, there’s
                            a standard
                            for everyone – and the number available is constantly on the rise. You can use the <a

                            tool to see what’s on offer. During the apprenticeship, your child will gain important
                            insight into their
                            chosen industry – and if they decide the occupation isn’t for them, they’ll be equipped with
                            skills and
                            qualifications to make them extremely employable, no matter what step they take next. In
                            fact, 88% of
                            apprentices remain in employment after completing their apprenticeship.

                            If your child isn’t sure which route to take, it’s worth remembering that they can keep
                            their options open. They could apply for both university degrees and apprenticeships,
                            for example, and make their final decision when they’ve had more time to research and
                            reflect.
