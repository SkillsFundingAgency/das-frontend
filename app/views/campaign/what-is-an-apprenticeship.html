                        <p>It's a real job,  with hands-on experience, a salary and the chance to train while you work. You get the same as other employees - a contract of employment, holiday leave, even sick pay.</p>
                        <p>If you're 16 or over, you can become an apprentice as long as you live in England and aren't in full-time education.</p>
                        <p><strong>Apprenticeships mean:</strong></p>

                        <ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-apprentice">
                            <li>You get paid and learn at the same time, with at least 20% of your time set aside for learning - usually at a college, university or a training provider.</li>
                            <li>You study for an official certification of your skills, equivalent to a qualification ranging from level two (equivalent to GCSE) all the way up to degree level.</li>
                            <li>You're on a career path, which has real potential for a higher salary and great prospects. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Your apprenticeship can take between one and five years to complete, depending on which one, and which level, you choose.</p>
                        <p>Different apprenticeships are available all over England, at companies large and small, in a wide range of industries and organisations. From local businesses to large national brands.</p>
                        <p>We've made some massive improvements to apprenticeships recently. They're no longer 'the easy option' - studying and working takes lots of effort and focus. Degree apprenticeships are now recognised as genuine, credible alternatives to full-time university courses.</p>
                        <p>Completing your apprenticeship means not only will you have less debt, and a valuable recognised qualification, you'll also hopefully have gained the skills needed to progress your career.</p>
                        <p>If you live in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, check out your apprenticeship options today.</p>
                        <h3 class="heading-m" id="heading2">What are the different types of apprenticeships?</h3>
                        <p>There are hundreds of different apprenticeships to choose from. Whether you're at the start of your career, want to change career direction, or if you're returning to work after a break. We have the apprenticeships for you.</p>
                        <p><strong>Which level is right for me?</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>(Level Tables Here)</strong></p>
                        <p>Here's a simple guide to the different apprenticeship levels, numbered from two to seven.</p>
                        <p>Degree apprenticeships offer the benefits of higher education, with none of the cost. Apprentices earn a salary right from day one of their employment and training. Your tuition fees are covered and paid in full, so you have the potential to graduate debt-free.</p>
